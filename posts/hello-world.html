<p>I got a new blog. I hope to retrieve my old blog posts, so that they don' get lost.
I have many plans for interesting article series and already a few drafts.</p>
<p>This blog is hosted as a Github Page in this Repository: <a href="https://github.com/TheAmazingPT/theamazingpt.github.io">https://github.com/TheAmazingPT/theamazingpt.github.io</a>
Every article will be its own &quot;article-branch&quot; and has to be merged into master.
Because of that you might follow the draft process in the respective &quot;article-branches&quot; or pull requests.</p>
<p>I am planning to write a lot about FreeBSD and my finding in Chicken Scheme, but the topics will be basically
all about web development and everything, which is attached to it.</p>
<p>I am now starting to write a blog again, because i have sometimes so many ideas in my head, which i simply
have to write out. But it could also help me to reflect myself and my ideas better. I am also always curious,
what i will think about my first articles in a year or two.</p>
