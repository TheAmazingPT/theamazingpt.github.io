Welcome to my blog. You can read here about my journey in the world of web development.
I focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the design of simple, functional and beautiful UI/UX.
You will also read a lot about Chicken Scheme, Clojure and ClojureScript and Elm.
I am also a big fan of FreeBSD and interested in DevOps and web app infrastructure.
